Nvidia CUDA Plataform
---------------------

> CUDA is a parallel computing platform and programming model that makes using a GPU for general purpose computing simple and elegant. The developer still programs in the familiar C, C++, Fortran, or an ever expanding list of supported languages, and incorporates extensions of these languages in the form of a few basic keywords.
These keywords let the developer express massive amounts of parallelism and direct the compiler to the portion of the application that maps to the GPU. [NVIDIA Blog] [1]
